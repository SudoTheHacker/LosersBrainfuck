# LosersBrainfuck
BrainFuck for Losers or in other words easier and more complete.
Currently under developement and will be released as pc1.0 or 0.1 (pc for proof of concept)

[ Feature on version 0.1 ]

i to input char  
v to make variable  
g"NO spaces tho" to go to your variable  
() parameters to loop have to be put to the left of the loop initializer  (Might get delayed)

[What to expect on finished product]
Python library support (You'll have to wait a good amount of time)



Execute code by putting your source code in the code variable and starting the program with python3.

Note: This is only a small project that I am working on the next programming language that will arrive, will be 10000x better and more worked on, but if you want to introduce your friend to programming language this one is supprisingly the easiest, by example:
i'h'.
Will give you the output: h
Why: 'i' means insert character (converted into ascii) to memory block and 'h' is your character. Easy right and '.' is to output, but it is not great for general use. I am gonna take a break if you want to propose bug fixes. I'll be happy to add it to the code.
